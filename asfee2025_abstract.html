<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The management of common-pool resources (CPRs) remains a key
challenge for sustainable resource allocation. A particularly
underexplored issue is the role of resource mobility and the
heterogeneity of marginal productivity across resource patches. While
previous studies have extensively examined CPR management in stationary
settings, fewer have considered mobile CPRs (MCPRs), where resources
migrate between different zones with asymmetric productivity levels.
This study seeks to deepen the understanding of MCPR management by
focusing on the allocation of property rights and the implications of
productivity differences across patches.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-benchmark">Theoretical Benchmark</h2>
<p>Our analysis is grounded in a discrete-time theoretical model in
which a natural resource stock is distributed across a spatial domain
divided into multiple patches. The stock dynamics in each patch are
influenced by harvests, local growth, and resource dispersion between
patches. We assume a linear growth function and analyze subgame perfect
Nash equilibria using backward induction, comparing different ownership
structures—single versus multiple owners per patch. Additionally, we
explore the implications of cooperative and non-cooperative behavior
among resource users. Analytical conditions are derived to characterize
equilibrium strategies based on ecological parameters such as growth
rates (<span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>)
and dispersion coefficients (<span
class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span>),
as well as the ownership structure. An efficient extraction path, which
maximizes aggregate payoffs, serves as a benchmark for comparison.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-property-rights-and-patch-productivity">Impact of
Property Rights and Patch Productivity</h2>
<p>A key area of investigation is the impact of property rights
allocation, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous patch
productivity, on management efficiency. One central hypothesis posits
that when a high-productivity patch is managed by a single agent, the
system is either more efficiently managed or exhibits no difference
compared to when it is managed by two agents. This hypothesis accounts
for both non-cooperative and locally cooperative interactions within the
two-owner patch. The rationale is that intra-patch dilemmas among
non-cooperative players in a high-productivity patch can lead to
overexploitation, with spillover effects on neighboring patches due to
resource mobility. However, if cooperation emerges between co-owners,
the management outcome may resemble that of the single-owner case.</p>
<p>The theoretical analysis suggests that when marginal productivity is
low in both patches (<span
class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>i</em><em>i</em></sub> × (1+<em>α</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) &lt; 1</span>),
the resource is depleted quickly regardless of ownership structure.
Conversely, when marginal productivity is high in both patches (<span
class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>i</em><em>i</em></sub> × (1+<em>α</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) &gt; 1</span>),
conservation until the final period can be optimal. The most interesting
case arises when marginal productivity differs between patches.</p>
<p>For instance, a single owner managing both a high- and a
low-productivity patch may conserve the resource in the low-productivity
patch, depending on dispersal parameters. In contrast, non-cooperative
co-owners are more likely to extract from the low-productivity patch
earlier, leading to inefficiencies in resource conservation. One of our
theoretical predictions suggests that MCPRs are managed less efficiently
in a given patch when a neighboring patch is co-managed by multiple
agents rather than a single agent.</p>
<h2 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h2>
<p>Based on these theoretical predictions, we formulate the following
hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>H1</strong>: In patches with higher productivity,
participants will delay extraction compared to lower-productivity
patches, maximizing long-term yields.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>H2</strong>: Individual ownership of a patch will lead to
more strategic resource conservation compared to collective ownership,
where coordination failures may emerge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h2>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we design a laboratory experiment to
analyze decision-making in a dynamic MCPR setting. Participants engage
in a game where they manage renewable resources across two patches (A
and B), which differ in their marginal productivity. In one treatment,
Patch A exhibits higher productivity than Patch B, while in another, the
productivity distribution is reversed. Resource stocks evolve
dynamically through a structured process involving harvesting, growth,
and migration between patches. Participants make sequential harvesting
decisions in groups of three, where one participant manages Patch A
(single-owner condition), and two participants jointly manage Patch B
(co-managed condition).</p>
<h2 id="results-and-policy-implications">Results and Policy
Implications</h2>
<p>The experiment was conducted in June 2024, with a total of 273
subjects. There were 51 groups in treatment <em>Ah</em> (high
productivity in Patch A) and 40 groups in treatment <em>Bh</em> (high
productivity in Patch B). Results indicate significant differences in
extraction behavior depending on patch productivity and ownership
structure.</p>
<p>Our findings provide policy-relevant insights, particularly for
designing governance mechanisms in sectors such as fisheries, forestry,
and land use management.</p>
