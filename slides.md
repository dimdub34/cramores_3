## Motivation

- How do property rights and productivity differences affect the management of common pool resources (CPRs)?
- We study a dynamic, mobile CPR context with uneven productivity and resource dispersion.
- Focus: consequences of **asymmetrical patch allocation** (1 vs. 2 players in productive areas).

---

## Experimental Setup

- Laboratory experiment at LEEM (Montpellier)
- N = 240 participants
- Between-subject design with 2 treatments:
  - **Ah**: One player manages high-productivity patch A
  - **Bh**: Two players manage high-productivity patch B
- 8 periods per game

---

## Game Mechanics

- Two zones: A and B
- Initial stock: 10 units per patch
- Harvest decision â†’ Growth â†’ Migration

$$
x_{i,t+1} = D_{ii} \cdot (1+\alpha_i) \cdot e_{i,t} + D_{ji} \cdot (1+\alpha_j) \cdot e_{j,t}
$$

- Payoffs: 0.70â‚¬ per unit harvested

## Decision Interface

![decision_screen_placeholder](img/decision_screen.png)

> Only the player's own slider determines their decision. The others simulate teammates' choices.

## Treatments

| Treatment | High-productivity | Players | Growth | Q |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------|---|
| **Ah**   | Zone A            | 1       | 1.6    | 1.2 |
| **Bh**   | Zone B            | 2       | 1.6    | 1.2 |

- Low-productivity patch always has growth = 1.1 (Q = 0.825)
- Migration: 25% from each zone to the other

---

## Main Hypothesis

> When the high-productivity patch is managed by one player (Ah), efficiency is higher than when it is managed by two players (Bh).

$$
H_0: Y_{g,Ah} = Y_{g,Bh} \quad H_1: Y_{g,Ah} < Y_{g,Bh}
$$

- $Y_{g,x}$: Sum of absolute deviations from efficient harvest per group

---

## Analysis Plan

- Shapiro-Wilk normality tests
- Parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon) comparisons
- Additional analysis:
  - Gini index for inequality
  - Behavior of single player
  - Role of trust, patience, reciprocity

---

## Efficiency â€“ Results

_ðŸ“Š Insert here your graph comparing deviation from efficient path in Ah vs Bh_

---

## Inequality â€“ Results

_ðŸ“Š Insert here your graph with Gini coefficients or payoff dispersion_

---

## Single Player Behavior

- Theory: Should wait until last period to harvest
- Observation: Early extraction when B over-exploits
- Interpretation: negative reciprocity or bounded rationality

---

## Individual Preferences

- Negative reciprocity â†” retaliation
- Trust â†” conservation effort
- Patience â†” long-term resource preservation

> Survey adapted from Falk et al. (2018)

---

## Conclusion

- Efficient management is more likely when high-productivity zones are managed by one player
- Asymmetric property rights mitigate overexploitation spillovers
- Social preferences and beliefs (trust, reciprocity) shape conservation behavior
